Sampling QoI smartly
Generation of data in a Bayesian fashion
Implement custom estimator
    - Relative error loss function
Implement inverse solver
Error model using high fidelity model
Analysis
    - Dependence of loss on the architecture
    - Preventing overfitting
Known Oversights:
    - Currently, the temp dist is interpolated to a full 2D grid. This wastes input space as the fin
      itself has a specific geometry. The reasoning for the full 2D grid is to work with CNNs better. 
      It may be a separate project to write a CNN with a non-standard geometry.
