Analysis
    - Dependence of loss on the architecture
    - Preventing overfitting

Known Oversights:
    - Currently, the temp dist is interpolated to a full 2D grid. This wastes input space as the fin
      itself has a specific geometry. The reasoning for the full 2D grid is to work with CNNs better. 
      It may be a separate project to write a CNN with a non-standard geometry.

Known bugs:
    - Plotting of the forward solver introduces gray lines

Urgent implementation
    - Measure time taken for training
    - Evalutate CNN with testing set
    - Change CNN architecture
    - GPU implementation 
    - Implement average loss and other metrics
    - Write per param error analysis
    - Better way to get a sense of the error

Research
    - Rewrite convolution using FEM theory
    - Train only specific fins. (5 separate CNNs for each parameter)
    - Research more about FEM inverse solves using NN (focused lit review)
    - Error model using high fidelity model (fine mesh Solves)
    - Sampling QoI smartly
    - Generation of data in a Bayesian fashion
    - DNN approach for nodal values
    - PyTorch?
